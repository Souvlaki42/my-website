# My Website

This repository contains my personal portfolio built with Astro, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. The project features a combination of static and server-side rendered pages, with dynamic content powered by Vercel. Syntax-highlighted code blocks are rendered using a customized Code component from {astro:components}, utilizing [Shiki](https://shiki.matsu.io/) for a clean and accurate display. The site maintains a strong focus on performance and design, achieving high Lighthouse scores on both mobile and desktop.
