# My Portfolio

This repository contains my personal portfolio built with Astro, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. The project features a combination of static and server-side rendered pages, with dynamic content powered by Vercel. Syntax-highlighted code blocks are rendered using a customized Code component from {astro:components}, utilizing [Shiki](https://shiki.matsu.io/) for a clean and accurate display. The site maintains a strong focus on performance and design, achieving high Lighthouse scores on both mobile and desktop.

## Features

- **Hybrid Static & Dynamic Rendering**: While the homepage is statically generated, other sections are server-side rendered, fetching live data from APIs.
- **Syntax Highlighting**: Powered by Shiki, ensuring accurate and aesthetically pleasing code blocks.
- **Fuzzy Search & Comment Section**: Enhanced functionality with JavaScript, providing a better user experience.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for both mobile and desktop, maintaining high performance metrics.

## Todo

- [ ] Integrate Obsidian
- [ ] Publish more blog posts
- [ ] Deal with the shiki bug
- [ ] Upgrade to Tailwind 4 when it's released
- [x] Upgrade to Astro 5 when it's released
