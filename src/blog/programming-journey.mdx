I've gained so much programming experience over the years. I change, the world changes, my tools and opinions change even quicker. I thought I will go through a nostalgic journey and give my opinion for all the technologies I've used. You might find it useful. Have no idea.

- I used [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu) back in the day to make simple browser games using code blocks as a kid. I'm kind of embarrassed to even say that.
- I also wrote some HTML and CSS for simple websites because I wanted to build my own portfolio.
- I then tried some Java tutorials because my innocent kid brain back then thought, that following some beginner level Java tutorials on YouTube is all I needed to get hired at Mojang, and work on my favorite game, Minecraft. I quickly got bored and abandoned that idea.
- I then learned Python for scripting purposes and simple programs. I also found out that I could make 2D games using a Python library called [Pygame](https://pyga.me). It is an SDL2 wrapper for Python, I used to make simple games following tutorials and had fun, although I never made anything serious with it. I still try it from time to time.
- Some time later, I learned to make Discord bots using [discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py) which was fun but quickly hit hit its limits and got frustrated with it. Its creator also discontinued it which finally pushed me to face my fears and try [discord.js](https://github.com/discordjs/discord.js).
- Believe it or not, that's my introduction to JavaScript. Although now discord.py is maintained again, I still went with JS.
- I experimented a bit with it a bit and even created a full bot for a friend's server.
- Eventually I liked JavaScript and went full in the rabbit hole of that ecosystem.
- I started using [Express.js](https://github.com/expressjs/express), [EJS](https://github.com/mde/ejs) and [mongoose](https://github.com/Automattic/mongoose) following [Web Dev Simplified](https://www.youtube.com/@WebDevSimplified) and other web dev creators on YouTube.
- After that phase, I migrated to React and Typescript because my needs increased and my stack couldn't handle it effectively.
- During that migration, I liked TypeScript so much that I started migrating all of projects to it. I just can't come back to JS after that.
- My current stage includes Next.js with app router and Typescript. B this is what you probably use as well if you do web dev stuff. I also use [Astro](https://astro.build) now for simple side projects and my own portfolio.
- During this period I experimented with over languages.
- Things like Golang and Rust are my new favorites. I used Go for some backend APIs, some CLI tools, some [Codecrafters](https://app.codecrafters.io/r/curious-reindeer-704519) projects (you can make them too using my link above for a free week of premium access, thanks). I also used Rust for some Codecrafters projects, a fast file manager application using [Tauri](https://tauri.app). I even solved my first [Advent Of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) year using it.
- I can still say I prefer Go however. I wish to right more of it in 2025. Rust is fine but I got tired of fighting the borrow checker and the build performance isn't good. Clearly my computer can't handle it right now. Go on the other hand is like Python but better.
- I have experimented with other languages as well all these years.
- Ruby, Elixir, Zig, C# (.NET) non of them are good enough for me right now but I might revisit them in the future. I used .NET for a notepad app once.
- I also used most game engines. Unity, Godot, Game maker 2.
- Unity is too hard for my computer to handle too. Godot isn't perfect but it is my favorite and the only one I still use and plan to continue using. I don't like Game maker much. I don't like its scripting language, UI nor pricing.
- I also started learning C and C++ for university recently. I hate them but can see why people still use them. Freedom and maximum performance it is. Similar for MATLAB.

I talked a lot about my experience and thoughts a lot in this post. I want to hear your opinions too. What's your journey? Do you agree with my opinions or not?
